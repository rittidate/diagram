     <h4>Asking questions</h4>
       <p>1.If you ask about the <b>subject</b> of the sentence, simply add the question word at the beginning:</p>
       <blockquote>
          <strong>James</strong> writes good poems. &mdash;  <strong>Who</strong> writes good poems? </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>2.If you ask about the predicate of the sentence (the part of a sentence which contains the verb and gives information about the subject), there are three options:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>If there is a helping (auxiliary) verb that precedes the main verb ( for example: can, is, are, was, were, will, would...), add the question word and invert the subject and the helping (auxiliary) verb.<br>
           <blockquote> 
           <u>He can</u> speak <strong>Chinese</strong>. &mdash; <strong>What</strong> <u>can he</u> speak?<br>  
            <u>They are</u> leaving <strong>tonight</strong>. &mdash; <strong>When</strong> <u>are they</u> leaving?</li>
            </blockquote>
         <li>If you ask about the <b>predicate</b> and there is <b>no helping (auxiliary) verb</b> and the verb is <b>"to be"</b>, simply add the <<b>question verb</b> and invert the subject and the verb.<br>
           <blockquote>
            <u>The  play was</u> <strong>interesting</strong>. &mdash; <strong>How</strong> <u>was the play</u>?</li>
            </blockquote>
         <li>If  there is no helping (auxiliary) verb in the the predicate and the main verb is not "to be", add the auxiliary "do" in the appropriate form.<br>
           <blockquote>
            They go to <strong>the movies</strong> every Saturday. &mdash; <strong>Where</strong> <u>do</u> they go every Saturday? <br>
           He wakes up <strong>early</strong>. 
           &mdash; <strong>When</strong> <u>does</u> he wake up?<br>
           They sent <strong>a letter</strong>. &mdash; <strong>What</strong> <u>did</u> they send?<br>
           </blockquote>
         </li>
