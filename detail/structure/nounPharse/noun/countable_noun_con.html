<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
<p>Countable nouns are easy to recognize. They are things that we can count. For example: "pen". We can count pens. We can have one, two, three or more pens. Here are some more countable nouns:</p>
<blockquote>
    dog, cat, animal, man, person<br>
    bottle, box, litre<br>
    coin, note, dollar<br>
    cup, plate, fork<br>
    table, chair, suitcase, bag
</blockquote>
<p>Countable nouns can be singular or plural:</p>
<blockquote>
    My dog is playing.<br>
    My dogs are hungry.
</blockquote>
<p>We can use the indefinite article a/an with countable nouns:</p>
<blockquote>
    A dog is an animal.
</blockquote>
<p>When a countable noun is singular, we must use a word like a/the/my/this with it:</p>
<blockquote>    
    I want an orange. <span class="error">(not I want orange.)</span><br>
    Where is my bottle? <span class="error">(not Where is bottle?)</span>
</blockquote>

<p>When a countable noun is plural, we can use it alone:</p>
<blockquote>
    I like oranges.<br>
    Bottles can break.
</blockquote>
<p>We can use some and any with countable nouns:</p>
<blockquote>
    I've got some dollars.<br>
    Have you got any pens?
</blockquote>
<p>We can use a few and many with countable nouns:</p>
<blockquote>
    I've got a few dollars.<br>
    I haven't got many pens.
