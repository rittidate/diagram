<p>Pronouns are small words that take the place of a noun. We can use a pronoun instead of a noun. Pronouns are words like: <strong>he</strong>, <strong>you</strong>, <strong>ours</strong>, <strong>themselves</strong>, <strong>some</strong>, <strong>each</strong>... If we didn't have pronouns, we would have to repeat a lot of nouns. We would have to say things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you like the manager? I don't like the manager. The manager's not friendly.</li>
</ul>

<p>With pronouns, we can say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you like the manager? I don't like <strong>him</strong>. <strong>He</strong>'s not friendly.</li>
</ul>
