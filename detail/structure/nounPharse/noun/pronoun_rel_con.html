<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">

<p>A relative pronoun is a pronoun that introduces a relative clause. It is called a "relative" pronoun because it "relates" to the word that its relative clause modifies. Here is an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The person <strong>who</strong> phoned me last night is my teacher.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above example, "who":</p>

<ul>
<li> relates to "The person", which "who phoned me last night" modifies</li>
<li>introduces the relative clause "who phoned me last night"      </li>
</ul>

<p>There are five relative pronouns: <strong>who</strong>, <strong>whom</strong>, <strong>whose</strong>, <strong>which</strong>, <strong>that</strong>*</p>

<p><strong>Who</strong> (subject) and <strong>whom</strong> (object) are generally only for people. <strong>Whose</strong> is for possession. <strong>Which</strong> is for things. <strong>That</strong> can be used for things <em>and</em> people only in <em>defining</em> relative clauses (clauses that are essential to the sentence and do not simply add extra information).**</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning"> Relative pronouns can refer to singular or plural, and there is no difference between male and female. </div>

<p>Look at these examples showing defining and non-defining relative clauses:</p>

*Not all grammar sources count "that" as a relative pronoun.<br>
**Some people claim that we should not use "that" for people but must use "who/whom". There is no good reason for such a claim; there is a long history of "that" for people in defining relative clauses from Chaucer, Shakespeare and the Authorized Version of <em>The Bible</em> to <em>Fowler's</em> and Churchill.
