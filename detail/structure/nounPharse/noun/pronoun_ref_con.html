<div class="alert alert-success"><dfn>reflexive</dfn> (adj.) [grammar]: reflecting back on the subject, like a mirror </div>
<p>We use a reflexive pronoun when we want to refer back to the subject of the sentence or clause. Reflexive pronouns end in "-self" (singular) or "-selves" (plural). </p>
<p>There are eight reflexive pronouns: </p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>reflexive pronoun</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>singular</td>
    <td><strong>myself<br>
      yourself<br>
      himself</strong>, <strong>herself</strong>, <strong>itself</strong></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>plural</td>
    <td><strong>ourselves</strong><br>
      <strong>yourselves</strong><br>
      <strong>themselves</strong></td>
    </tr>
</tbody>

<h4>Intensive pronouns </h4>

<p>Notice that all the above reflexive pronouns can also act as intensive pronouns, but the function and usage are different. An intensive pronoun emphasizes its antecedent. Look at these examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I made it <strong>myself</strong>. <i>OR</i>    I <strong>myself</strong> made it.</li>
  <li>Have you  <strong>yourself</strong> seen it? <i>OR</i> Have you seen it <strong>yourself</strong>? </li>
  <li>The President <strong>himself</strong> promised to stop the war.</li>
  <li>She spoke to me <strong>herself</strong>. <i>OR</i> She <strong>herself</strong> spoke to me. </li>
  <li>The exam <strong>itself</strong> wasn't difficult, but the exam room was horrible. </li>
  <li>Never mind. We'll do it <strong>ourselves</strong>. </li>
  <li>You <strong>yourselves</strong> asked us to do it.</li>
  <li>They recommend this book even though they <strong>themselves</strong> had never read it. <i>OR</i>    They recommend this book even though they  had never read it <strong>themselves</strong>.</li>
</ul>
