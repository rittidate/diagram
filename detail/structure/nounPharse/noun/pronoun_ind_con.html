    <h3 class="modal-title">Indefinite Pronouns</h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
<p>An indefinite pronoun does not refer to any specific person, thing or amount. It is vague and "not definite". Some typical indefinite pronouns are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>all, another, any, anybody/anyone, anything, each, everybody/everyone, everything, few, many, nobody, none, one, several, some, somebody/someone</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-warning"> Note that many indefinite pronouns also function as other parts of speech. Look at "another" in the following sentences: 
  <ul>
    <li>He has one job in the day and another at night. (pronoun) </li>
      <li>I'd like another drink, please. (adjective)  </li>
      </ul>
</div>
<p>Most indefinite pronouns are either singular or plural. However, some of them can be singular in one context and plural in another. The most common indefinite pronouns are listed below, with examples, as singular, plural or singular/plural. </p>
<p>Notice that a singular <strong>pronoun</strong> takes a singular <i>verb</i> AND that any personal pronoun should also <i>agree</i> (in number and gender). Look at these examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Each</strong> of the players <i>has</i> a doctor. </li>
  <li>I met two girls. <strong>One</strong> <i>has</i> given me <i>her</i> phone number. </li>
  </ul>
<p>Similarly, plural <strong>pronouns</strong> need plural <i>agreement</i>: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Many</strong> <i>have</i> expressed <i>their</i> views.  </li>
</ul>

* Some people say that "none" should always take a singular verb, even when talking about countable nouns (eg five friends). They argue that "none" means "no one", and "one" is obviously singular. They say that "I invited five friends but none <strong>has</strong> come" is correct and "I invited five friends but none <strong>have</strong> come" is incorrect. Historically and grammatically there is little to support this view. "None" has been used for hundreds of years with both a singular and a plural verb, according to the context and the emphasis required.
