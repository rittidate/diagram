    <h3 class="modal-title">Personal Pronouns</h3>
</div>
<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
<p>Personal pronouns represent specific people or things. We use them depending on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>number: singular (eg: <strong>I</strong>) or plural (eg: <strong>we</strong>)</li>
  <li>person: 1st person (eg: <strong>I</strong>), 2nd person (eg: <strong>you</strong>) or 3rd person (eg: <strong>he</strong>)</li>
  <li>gender: male (eg: <strong>he</strong>), female (eg: <strong>she</strong>) or neuter (eg: <strong>it</strong>)</li>
  <li>case: subject (eg: <strong>we</strong>) or object (eg: <strong>us</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We use personal pronouns in place of the person or people that we are talking about. My name is Josef but when I am talking about myself I almost always use "I" or "me", not "Josef". When I am talking direct to you, I almost always use "you", not your name. When I am talking about another person, say John, I may start with "John" but then use "he" or "him". And so on.</p>

<p>Here are the personal pronouns, followed by some example sentences:</p>

<p>Examples (in each pair, the first sentence shows a <strong>subject pronoun</strong>, the second an <strong>object pronoun</strong>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I</strong> like coffee. / John helped <strong>me</strong>.</li>
  <li>Do <strong>you</strong> like coffee? / John loves <strong>you</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>He</strong> runs fast. / Did Ram beat <strong>him</strong>?</li>
  <li><strong>She</strong> is clever. / Does Mary know <strong>her</strong>?</li>
  <li><strong>It</strong> doesn't work. / Can the man fix <strong>it</strong>?</li>
  <li><strong>We</strong> went home. / Anthony drove <strong>us</strong>.</li>
  <li>Do <strong>you</strong> need a table for three? / Did John and Mary beat <strong>you</strong> at doubles?</li>
  <li><strong>They</strong> played doubles. / John and Mary beat <strong>them</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When we are talking about a single thing, we almost always use <strong>it</strong>. However, there are a few exceptions. We may sometimes refer to an animal as <strong>he</strong>/<strong>him</strong> or <strong>she</strong>/<strong>her</strong>, especially if the animal is domesticated or a pet. Ships (and some other vessels or vehicles) as well as some countries are often treated as female and referred to as <strong>she</strong>/<strong>her</strong>. Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>This is our dog Rusty. <strong>He</strong>'s an Alsatian.</li>
  <li>The <i>Titanic</i> was a great ship but <strong>she</strong> sank on her first voyage.</li>
  <li>My first car was a Mini and I treated <strong>her</strong> like my wife.</li>
  <li>Thailand has now opened <strong>her</strong> border with Cambodia.</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
<p>For a single person, sometimes we don't know whether to use <strong>he</strong> or <strong>she</strong>. There are several solutions to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>If a teacher needs help, <strong>he or she</strong> should see the principal.</li>
  <li>If a teacher needs help, <strong>he</strong> should see the principal.</li>
  <li>If a teacher needs help, <strong>they</strong> should see the principal.</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
<p>We often use <strong>it</strong> to introduce a remark:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>It</strong> is nice to have a holiday sometimes.</li>
  <li><strong>It</strong> is important to dress well.</li>
  <li><strong>It</strong>'s difficult to find a job.</li>
  <li>Is <strong>it</strong> normal to see them together?</li>
  <li><strong>It</strong> didn't take long to walk here.</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
<p>We also often use <strong>it</strong> to talk about the weather, temperature, time and distance:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>It</strong>'s raining.</li>
  <li><strong>It</strong> will probably be hot tomorrow.</li>
  <li><strong>Is</strong> it nine o'clock yet?</li>
  <li><strong>It</strong>'s 50 kilometres from here to Cambridge.</li>
</ul>
