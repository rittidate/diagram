<h4>What Are Common Nouns?</h4>
<p>Everything we can see or discuss is represented by a word that names it. That word is called a noun.</p>

<p>A common noun is the word for something (e.g., boy, cat, lake, bridge). It is different from a proper noun, which is the name we give to something (e.g., Peter, Lucky, Lake Superior, The London Bridge).</p>

<p>All nouns can be categorized into one of two groups: common nouns and proper nouns.</p>

<p>This page is about common nouns, but it is worth learning about common nouns and proper nouns at the same time.</p>
<h4>A More Formal Definition of Common Noun</h4>
<p>A common noun is used for a class of person, place, or thing. (A proper noun is used for a specific person, place, or thing.)</p>
