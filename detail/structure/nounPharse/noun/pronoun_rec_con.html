<div class="alert alert-success"><dfn>reciprocal</dfn> (adj.): given or done in return; [grammar] expressing mutual action </div>

<p>We use reciprocal pronouns when each of two or more subjects is acting in the same way towards the other. For example, A is talking to B, and B is talking to A. So we say:</p>

<ul>
<li>A and B are talking to <strong>each other</strong>. </li>
</ul>

<p>The action is "reciprocated". John talks to Mary and Mary talks to John. I give you a present and you give me a present. The dog bites the cat and the cat bites the dog.</p>

<p>There are only two reciprocal pronouns, and they are both two words:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>each other</strong></li>
  <li><strong>one another    </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When we use these reciprocal pronouns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there must be <strong>two or more</strong> people, things or groups involved (so we cannot use reciprocal pronouns with I, you [singular], he/she/it)</li>
  <li>they must be <strong>doing the same thing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Look at these examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>John and Mary love <strong>each other</strong>.</li>
  <li>Peter and David hate <strong>each other</strong>.</li>
  <li>The ten prisoners were all blaming <strong>one another</strong>. </li>
  <li>Both teams played hard against <strong>each other</strong>.</li>
  <li>We gave <strong>each other</strong> gifts. </li>
  <li>Why don't you believe <strong>each other</strong>?</li>
  <li>They can't see <strong>each other</strong>.</li>
  <li>The gangsters were  fighting <strong>one another</strong>. </li>
  <li>The boats were bumping against <strong>each other </strong> in the storm.    </li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning">You probably noticed that <strong>each other</strong> is used in more examples above than <strong>one another</strong>. That's because in general we use <strong>one another</strong> (which sounds a little formal) less often than we use <strong>each other</strong>. Also, some people say that we should use <strong>one another</strong> only for three or more people or things, but there is no real justification for this.</div>
