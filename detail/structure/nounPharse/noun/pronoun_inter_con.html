<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
<p>We use interrogative pronouns to ask questions. The interrogative pronoun represents the thing that we don't know (what we are asking the question about). </p>

<p>There are four main interrogative pronouns: <strong>who</strong>, <strong>whom</strong>, <strong>what</strong>, <strong>which</strong> </p>

<p>Notice that the <span class="emp">possessive pronoun</span> <strong>whose</strong> can also be an interrogative pronoun (an interrogative possessive pronoun).</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">Notice that <strong>whom</strong> is the correct form when the pronoun is the object of the verb, as in "<strong>Whom</strong> did you see?" ("I saw <strong>John</strong>.") However, in normal, spoken English we rarely use <strong>whom</strong>. Most native speakers would say (or even write): "<strong>Who</strong> did you see?"</div>

<p>Look at these example questions. In the sample answers, the noun phrase that the interrogative pronoun represents is shown <strong>in bold</strong>. </p>

<p><span class="emp">Note</span> that we sometimes use the suffix "-ever" to make compounds from some of these pronouns (mainly <strong>whoever</strong>, <strong>whatever</strong>, <strong>whichever</strong>). When we add "-ever", we use it for emphasis, often to show confusion or surprise. Look at these examples: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Whoever</strong> would want to do such a nasty thing? </li>
  <li><strong>Whatever</strong> did he say to make her cry like that? </li>
  <li>They're all fantastic! <strong>Whichever</strong> will you choose? </li>
</ul>
