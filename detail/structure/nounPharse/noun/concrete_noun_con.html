<h4>What is a Concrete Noun?</h4>

<p>Objects and substances that can be experienced through our senses are referred to as concrete nouns.  That means we can touch, feel, smell, taste or hear them.</p>
<p><b>Examples of Concrete Nouns</b></p>

<p>The vast majority of nouns are concrete nouns.   Take all animals and people for example. You can touch, feel, see, and hear them.  You can do the same for objects. We take in with our eyes all the sights of places we visit.</p><br>
<p>Flowers, panther, cinnamon, sunset, rain, cookies…these are just a few concrete nouns.</p>
<blockquote>
The yellow <b>flowers</b> flowed from a glass red vase.<br>
Suddenly, a large roaring black <b>panther</b> appeared from behind the rock.<br>
Mother’s kitchen always smells like <b>cinnamon</b> during the holidays.<br>
The <b>sunset</b> unfurled ribbons of red, purple, and gold across the sky.<br>
Walking home I was assaulted by <b>rain</b> droplets that fell like bullets from the sky.<br>
<b>Cookies</b> baking in the oven means Grandma has come to visit.
</blockquote>
<p>Some concrete nouns are countable nouns. Countable nouns have both a singular and a plural form.</b>
<blockquote>
A brick.  Two bricks.
<br>
A book.  Three books.
<br>
A horse. Four horses.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b><span class="emp">Uncountablee</span> concrete nouns</b> do not have a plural form. We can’t separate them into individual elements to count. Milk, air, sugar, salt, wood, rice, electricity and water are also uncountable nouns. Concrete nouns can be collective nouns, common nouns, and proper nouns as well.
