<div class="modal-body modal-fixed-height">
<p>We use possessive pronouns to refer to a specific person/people or thing/things (the "antecedent") belonging to a person/people (and sometimes belonging to an animal/animals or thing/things).</p>
<p>We use possessive pronouns depending on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>number: singular (eg: <strong>mine</strong>) or plural (eg: <strong>ours</strong>)</li>
  <li>person: 1st person (eg:<strong> mine</strong>), 2nd person (eg: <strong>yours</strong>) or 3rd person (eg: <strong>his</strong>)</li>
  <li>gender: male (<strong>his</strong>), female (<strong>hers</strong>) </li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
<p>Below are the possessive pronouns, followed by some example sentences. Notice that each possessive pronoun can:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> be subject <i>or</i> object</li>
  <li>refer to a singular <i>or</i> plural antecedent</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
