<p><strong>Interrogative determiners</strong> are determiners that formulate direct or indirect questions and exclamations. Like other determiners, interrogative determiners perform the grammatical function of determinative.</p>
<p><b>Using Interrogative Determiners</b></p>
<p>Interrogative determiners most commonly <strong>formulate questions</strong>, both direct and indirect. For example, the following direct questions contain interrogative determiners:</p>
<blockquote>
<li><i>What</i> toppings do you want on your half of the pizza?</li>
<li><i>Which</i> university are you attending this fall?</li>
<li><i>Whose</i> baby are you watching all night?</li>
</blockquote>
<p>The following <strong>indirect questions</strong> also contain interrogative determiners:</p>
<blockquote>
<li>You want <i>what</i> toppings on your half of the pizza?</li>
<li>You are attending <i>which</i> university this fall?</li>
<li>You are watching <i>whose</i> baby all night?</li>
</blockquote>
<p>Although most frequently used within interrogative constructions, interrogative determiners also <strong>formulate exclamations</strong>. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<li>You want <i>what</i> toppings on your half of the pizza!</li>
<li>You are attending <i>which</i> university this fall!</li>
<li>You are watching <i>whose</i> baby all night!</li>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>Note</u></strong> that indirect questions and exclamations are identical in grammatical structure.</p>
<p>Interrogative determiners formulate direct or indirect questions and exclamations. The <strong>three interrogative determiners</strong> in English are <i>what</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>whose</i>.</p>
