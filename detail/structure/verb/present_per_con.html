<p>The <strong>present perfect</strong> is formed from the present tense of the verb <strong><em>have</em></strong> and the <strong>past participle</strong> of a verb:</p>
<p>The present perfect <strong>continuous </strong>is formed with <strong><em>have/has been </em></strong>and the <em><strong>-ing</strong></em> form of the verb:</p>

<p>We use the present perfect tense:</p>
<ul><li>for something that started in the <strong>past </strong>and <strong>continues </strong>in the <strong>present</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>They<strong>’ve been married</strong> <u>for nearly fifty years</u>.<br>
She <strong>has lived</strong> in Liverpool <u>all her life</u>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We normally use the present perfect continuous for this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She <strong>has been living</strong> in Liverpool all her life.<br>
It<strong>’s been raining</strong> for hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>for something we have done <strong>several times</strong> in the <strong>past</strong> and <strong>continue</strong> to do:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I<strong>’ve played</strong> the guitar ever since I was a teenager.<br>
He <strong>has written</strong> three books and he is working on another one.<br>
I<strong>’ve been watching</strong> that programme every week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often use a clause with <strong><em>since </em></strong>to show <strong>when </strong>something <strong>started </strong>in the past:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They<strong>’ve been staying</strong> with us <u>since last week</u>. <br>
I <strong>have worked</strong> here <u>since I left school</u>.<br>
I<strong>’ve been watching</strong> that programme every week <u>since it started</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>when we are talking about our <strong>experience up to the present</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>Note</strong>: We often use the adverb <strong><em>ever </em></strong>to talk about experience up to the present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My last birthday was the worst day I <strong>have ever had</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: and we use never for the negative form:</p>
<p><strong>Have you</strong> <u><strong>ever</strong></u> <strong>met</strong> George?<br>
Yes, but <strong>I’ve <u>never</u> met</strong> his wife.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>for something that happened in the past but is <b>important at the time of speaking</b>:</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I can’t get in the house. I<strong>’ve lost</strong> my keys.<br>
Teresa isn’t at home. I think <strong>she has gone</strong> shopping.<br>
I’m tired out. I<strong>’ve been working</strong> all day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use the present perfect of <strong><em>be</em></strong> when someone has <strong>gone </strong>to a place and <strong>returned</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Where <strong>have you been</strong>?<br>
B: I’ve <strong>just been out to the supermarket</strong>.</p>
<p>A: <strong>Have you ever been to </strong>San Francisco?<br>
B: No, but <strong>I’ve been</strong> to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>But when someone <strong>has not returned </strong>we use <strong><em>have/has gone</em></strong>:</p>
<p>A: Where is Maria? I haven’t seen her for weeks. <br>
B: <strong>She's gone to </strong>Paris for a week. <u>She’ll be back tomorrow</u>.</p>
<p>We often use the present perfect with <strong>time adverbials </strong>which refer to the <strong>recent past</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><em>just; only just; recently</em></strong>;</p>
<p>Scientists <strong>have <u>recently</u> discovered</strong> a new breed of monkey. <br>
We <strong>have <u>just</u> got</strong> back from our holidays.</p>
<p>or adverbials which <strong>include the present</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><em>ever </em></strong>(in questions); <strong><em>so far</em></strong>; <strong><em>until now</em></strong>; <strong><em>up to now</em></strong>; <strong><em>yet</em></strong> (in questions and negatives)</p>
<p><strong>Have you </strong><u>ever</u><strong> seen</strong> a ghost?<br><strong>Where have you been</strong> <u>up to now</u>?<br><strong>Have you finished</strong> your homework <u>yet</u>?<br>
No, <u>so far</u> I<strong>’ve</strong> only <strong>done</strong> my history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> We do <span class="emp">not</strong> use the present perfect with an <strong>adverbial</strong> which refers to <strong>past time</strong> which is <strong>finished</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have seen that film <span class="error">yesterday</span>.<br>
We have just bought a new car <span class="error">last week</span>.<br><span class="error">When we were children</span> we have been to California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we can use it to refer to a time which is <strong>not</strong> yet <strong>finished</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you seen Helen <u>today</u>?<br>
We have bought a new car <u>this week</u>.</p>
