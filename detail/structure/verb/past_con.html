<h4>Forms</h4>
<p>With most verbs the past tense is formed by adding -ed:</p>
<p>call &gt;&gt; called; like &gt;&gt; liked; want &gt;&gt; wanted; work &gt;&gt; worked</p>
<p>But there are a lot of irregular past tenses in English. Here are the most common irregular verbs in English, with their past tenses:</p>
<h4>Use</h4>
<p>We use the past tense to talk about:</p>
<ul><li>
    something that happened <strong>once in the past</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>I <strong>met </strong>my wife in 1983.<br>
  We <strong>went </strong>to Spain for our holidays.<br>
  They <strong>got </strong>home very late last night.</blockquote>
<ul><li>
    something that happened <strong>again and again in the past</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>When I was a boy I <strong>walked </strong>a mile to school every day.<br>
  We <strong>swam </strong>a lot while we were on holiday.<br>
  They always <strong>enjoyed </strong>visiting their friends.</blockquote>
<ul><li>
    something that was <strong>true for some time </strong>in the past:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>I <strong>lived </strong>abroad for ten years.<br>
  He <strong>enjoyed </strong>being a student.<br>
  She <strong>played </strong>a lot of tennis when she was younger.</blockquote>
<ul><li>
    we often use phrases with <strong><em>ago </em></strong>with the past tense:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>I <u>met</u> my wife a long time <strong>ago</strong>.</blockquote>
<h4>
  Questions and negatives</h4>
<p>We use <strong><em>did </em></strong>to make questions with the past tense:</p>
<blockquote>When <strong>did you meet</strong> your wife?<br>
  Where <strong>did you go</strong> for your holidays?<br><strong>Did she play</strong> tennis when she was younger?<br><strong>Did you live </strong>abroad?</blockquote>
<p class="emp">But look at these questions:</p>
<blockquote>Who discovered penicillin?<br>
  Who wrote Don Quixote?</blockquote>
<p>For more on these questions see <strong>question forms</strong></p>
<p>We use <strong>didn’t</strong> (<strong>did not</strong>) to make <strong>negatives </strong>with the past tense:</p>
<blockquote>They <strong>didn’t go</strong> to Spain this year.<br>
  We <strong>didn’t get </strong>home until very late last night.<br>
  I <strong>didn’t see </strong>you yesterday.</blockquote>
