<p>We use the verb <em><strong>had</strong></em> and the <strong>past participle </strong>for the <strong>past perfect</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I <strong>had finished </strong>the work.<br>
  She <strong>had gone </strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The past perfect <strong>continuous </strong>is formed with <em><strong>had been </strong></em>and the <strong>-</strong><em><strong>ing</strong> </em>form of the verb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I <strong>had been </strong>finish<strong>ing</strong> the work<br><strong>She had been</strong> go<strong>ing</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The past perfect is used in the same way as the present perfect, but it refers to a time in the past, not the present.</p>
<p>We use the past perfect tense:</p>
<ul><li>
    for something that started in the past and continued up to a given time in the past:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When George died he and Anne <strong>had been married </strong>for nearly fifty years.<br>
  She didn’t want to move. She <strong>had lived </strong>in Liverpool all her life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We normally use the past perfect <strong>continuous </strong>for this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She didn’t want to move. She <strong>had been living </strong>in Liverpool all her life.<br>
  Everything was wet. It <strong>had been raining </strong>for hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>
    for something we had done <strong>several times </strong>up to a point in the past and <strong>continued </strong>to do <strong>after that point</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>He was a wonderful guitarist. He <strong>had been playing </strong>ever since he was a teenager.<br>
  He <strong>had written three </strong>books and he was working on another one.<br>
  I <strong>had been watching </strong>the programme every week, but I missed the last episode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often use a clause with <em><strong>since </strong></em>to show when something started in the past:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They had been staying with us <strong>since </strong><u>the previous week</u>.<br>
  I was sorry when the factory closed. I had worked there <strong>since </strong><u>I left school</u>.<br>
  I had been watching that programme every week <strong>since</strong> <u>it started</u>, but I missed the last episode.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>
    when we are reporting our experience and including up to the (then) present:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>My eighteenth birthday was the worst day I had ever had.<br>
  I was pleased to meet George. I hadn’t met him before, even though I had met his wife several times.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>
    for something that happened in the past but is important at the time of reporting:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t get into the house.<strong> I had lost </strong>my keys.<br>
  Teresa wasn’t at home. <strong>She had gone </strong>shopping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use the past perfect to talk about the past in <strong>conditions</strong>, <strong>hypotheses </strong>and <strong>wishes</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would have helped him <u>if</u> <strong>he had asked</strong>.<br>
  It was very dangerous. <u>What if</u> <strong>you had got</strong> lost?<br><u>I wish</u> <strong>I hadn’t spent</strong> so much money last month.</p>
