<p>The present tense is the <strong>base form </strong>of the verb: I <strong>work</strong> in London.<br>
  But the third person (she/he/it) adds an <strong><em>-s</em></strong>: She <strong>work</strong><u><strong>s</strong></u> in London.</p>
<h4>Use</h4>
<p>We use the present tense to talk about:</p>
<ul><li>
    something that is true in the <strong>present</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I<strong>’m </strong>nineteen years old.<br>
  He <strong>lives </strong>in London.<br>
  I<strong>’m</strong> a student.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>
    something that happens again and again in the present:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I <strong>play </strong>football every weekend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We use words like <strong>sometimes</strong>, <strong>often</strong>. <strong>always</strong>, and <strong>never</strong> <span class="describe">(adverbs of frequency)</span> with the present tense</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I <strong>sometimes </strong>go to the cinema.<br>
  She <strong>never </strong>plays football.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>something that is <strong>always true</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The adult human body <strong>contains </strong>206 bones.<br>
  Light <strong>travels </strong>at almost 300,000 kilometres per second.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>
    something that is fixed in the future.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The school term <strong>starts</strong> next week.<br>
  The train <strong>leaves </strong>at 1945 this evening.<br>
  We <strong>fly </strong>to Paris next week.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
  Questions and negatives</h4>
<p>Look at these questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you play the piano?<br>
  Where do you live?<br>
  Does Jack play football?<br>
  Where does he come from?<br>
  Do Rita and Angela live in Manchester?<br>
  Where do they work?</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul><li>
    With the present tense, we use <em><strong>do </strong></em>and <em><strong>does </strong></em>to make questions. We use <strong><em>does </em></strong>for the third person (she/he/it) and we use <strong><em>do </em></strong>for the others.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use <strong><em>do </em></strong>and <strong><em>does </em></strong>with question words like <strong><em>where</em></strong>, <em><strong>what </strong></em>and <strong><em>why</em></strong>:</p>
<p>But look at these questions with who:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who lives in London?<br>
  Who plays football at the weekend?<br>
  Who works at Liverpool City Hospital?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look at these sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like tennis, but I don’t like football. (don’t = do not)<br>
  I don’t live in London now.<br>
  I don’t play the piano, but I play the guitar.<br>
  They don’t work at the weekend.<br>
  John doesn’t live in Manchester. (doesn’t = does not)<br>
  Angela doesn’t drive to work. She goes by bus.</p>
  </blockquote>
<ul><li>
    With the present tense we use <strong><em>do </em></strong>and <strong><em>does </em></strong>to make negatives. We use does not (<em><strong>doesn’t</strong></em>) for the third person (she/he/it) and we use do not (<em><strong>don’t</strong></em>) for the others.</li>
</ul>
