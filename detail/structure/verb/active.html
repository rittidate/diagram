<p><strong>Transitive verbs </strong>have both <strong>active </strong>and <strong>passive </strong>forms:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%"><thead>
    <tr><th scope="col"><strong>active</strong></th>
            <th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col"><strong>passive</strong></th>
        </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The hunter killed the lion.</td>
            <td>&gt;&gt;</td>
            <td>The lion was killed by the hunter.</td>
        </tr><tr><td>Someone has cleaned the windows</td>
            <td>&gt;&gt;</td>
            <td>The windows have been cleaned</td>
        </tr></tbody></table><p><br>
The passive forms are made up of the verb <em><strong>be</strong></em> with a <strong>past participle</strong>:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%"><thead><tr><th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col"><strong><em>be</em></strong></th>
            <th scope="col"><strong>past participle</strong></th>
            <th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
        </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>English</td>
            <td>is</td>
            <td>spoken</td>
            <td>all over the world</td>
        </tr><tr><td>The windows</td>
            <td>have been</td>
            <td>cleaned</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr><tr><td>Lunch</td>
            <td>was being</td>
            <td>served</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr><tr><td>The work</td>
            <td>will be</td>
            <td>finished</td>
            <td>soon</td>
        </tr><tr><td>They</td>
            <td>might have been</td>
            <td>invited</td>
            <td>to the party</td>
        </tr></tbody></table><p><br>
We sometimes use the verb <strong><em>get</em></strong> to form the passive:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Be careful with the glass. It might <strong>get </strong>broken.<br>
Peter <strong>got </strong>hurt in a crash.</p>
<p>If we want to show the person or thing doing the action we use <strong><em>by</em></strong>:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">She was attacked <strong>by </strong>a dangerous dog.<br>
The money was stolen <strong>by </strong>her husband.</p>
<p>We can use the <strong>indirect object </strong>as the subject of a passive verb:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">
</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%"><thead><tr><th scope="col"><strong>active</strong></th>
            <th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col"><strong>passive</strong></th>
        </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>I gave him a book for his birthday</td>
            <td>&gt;&gt;</td>
            <td>He was given a book for his birthday.</td>
        </tr><tr><td>Someone sent her a cheque for a thousand euros</td>
            <td>&gt;&gt;</td>
            <td>She was sent a cheque for a thousand euros.</td>
        </tr></tbody></table><p><br>
We can use <strong>phrasal verbs </strong>in the passive:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">
</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%"><thead><tr><th scope="col"><strong>active</strong></th>
            <th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col"><strong>passive</strong></th>
        </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>They <strong>called off </strong>the meeting.</td>
            <td>&gt;&gt;</td>
            <td>The meeting <strong>was called off</strong>.</td>
        </tr><tr><td>His grandmother <strong>looked after</strong> him.</td>
            <td>&gt;&gt;</td>
            <td>He <strong>was looked after </strong>by his grandmother.</td>
        </tr><tr><td>They <strong>will send </strong>him <strong>away </strong>to school.</td>
            <td>&gt;&gt;</td>
            <td>He <strong>will be sent away </strong>to school.</td>
        </tr></tbody></table><p>Some verbs very <strong>frequently used in the passive </strong>are followed by the <strong>to-infinitive</strong>:</p>
<p class="rteindent1">
</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td>be supposed to</td>
            <td>be expected to</td>
            <td>be asked to</td>
        </tr><tr><td>be scheduled to</td>
            <td>be allowed to</td>
            <td>be told to</td>
        </tr></tbody></table><p class="rteindent1">John<strong> has been asked to</strong> make a speech at the meeting.<br>
You <strong>are supposed to</strong> wear a uniform.<br>
The meeting <strong>is scheduled to</strong> start at seven.&nbsp;</p>
