The <span class="emp">FUTURE TENSE</span> indicates that an action is in the future relative to the speaker or writer. There are no inflected forms for the future in English (nothing like those <b>-ed</b> or <b>-s</b> endings in the other tenses). Instead, the future tense employs the helping verbs <b>will</b> or <b>shall</b> with the base form of the verb: 
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>She <span class="emp">will leave</span> soon. </li>
<li>We <span class="emp">shall overcome</span>.</li>
</ul> 
</blockquote>
The future is also formed with the use of a form of <b>"go"</b> plus the infinitive of the verb: 
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He <span class="emp">is going to faint</span>.</li>
</ul> English can even use the present to suggest the future tense: <ul>
<li>I <span class="emp">am leaving</span> later today."</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that the auxiliary <b>will</b> can be combined with "be" and a progressive form of the main verb to create a sense of the future that does not harbor any hint of insistence (which is possible with the auxiliary alone). For instance, if stress is placed on the word <b>will</b> in "When <span class="emp">will</span> you arrive?", the sentence can sound impatient, insistent. In "When <span class="emp">will</span> you <span class="emp">be arriving</span>?" there is less of that emotional overtone. 
</p>
<p>
The construction <u>form of <i>to be</i> + infinitive</u> is used to convey a sense of planning for the future, command, or contingency. </p>

<ul>
<li>There <span class="emp">is to be</span> an investigation into the mayor's business affairs. 
</li><li>You <span class="emp">are to be</span> back on the base by midnight.
</li><li>If he <span class="emp">is to pass</span> this exam, he'll have to study harder.
</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
To create a sense of imminent fulfillment, the word <i>about</i> can be combined with the infinitive.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He <span class="emp">is about to die</span>.</li></ul>
</blockquote>
Other adverbs can be used in similar constructions with various effects:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He <span class="emp">is liable to get</span> in trouble.
</li><li>She <span class="emp">is certain to do</uspan> well in college.</li></ul>
